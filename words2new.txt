The city council has determined that they have enough money to remove exactly one cloud using their latest technology Thus they want to remove the cloud such that the fewest number of people are left in darkness after the cloud is removed What is the maximum number of people that will be in a sunny town after removing exactly one cloud

Note If a town is not covered by any clouds then it is already considered to be sunny and the population of this town must also be included in the final answer

Complete the function maximum People which takes four arrays representing the populations of each town locations of the towns locations of the clouds and the extents of coverage of the clouds respectively and returns the maximum number of people that will be in a sunny town after removing exactly one cloud

Input Format develo  abcx randomy



The first line of input contains a single integer  the number of towns

The next line contains  space separated integers  The  integer in this line denotes the population of the town

The next line contains  space separated integers  denoting the location of the  town on the one dimensional line

The next line consists of a single integer  denoting the number of clouds covering the city

The next line contains  space separated integers  the  of which denotes the location of the  cloud on the coordinate axis

The next line consists of  space separated integers  denoting the range of the  cloud

Note The range of each cloud is computed according to its location ie the  cloud is located at position  and it covers every town within a distance of  from it In other words the  cloud covers every town with location in the range
